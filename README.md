## Description
<!--
Give a short description on what your project accomplishes and what tools is uses. In addition, you can drop screenshots directly into your README file to add them to your README. Take these from your presentations.

Our project goes through several iterations of facial detection and facial recognition models. In the end, the functionality includes predicting an identity based on an uploaded file, a photo taken live from the webcam, and in the demos, even identification from a live video feed. Below are some examples of our program at work.
